"""Pluggable executor backend interface.

Two Protocols form the swap-point between
:func:`gigaevo.programs.stages.python_executors.wrapper.run_exec_runner`
and the concrete subprocess pool:

* :class:`ExecutorBackend` — the required core contract
  (``execute`` + ``shutdown``).  Every backend must implement this.
* :class:`LifecycleObservable` — optional observation hooks
  (``on_submit`` / ``on_complete`` / ``on_shutdown``).  Backends that
  have nothing useful to notify simply do not implement it; callers
  gate hook registration on ``isinstance(backend, LifecycleObservable)``.

:class:`LokyBackend` in
:mod:`gigaevo.programs.stages.python_executors.wrapper` is the only
implementation today and conforms to both.  Future backends
(Redis-Stream-mediated remote workers, HTTP submission services,
Ray actors) implement at minimum :class:`ExecutorBackend` and slot in
at call sites without modification.  Per-worker-process lifecycle
(``on_worker_start``, ``on_worker_exit``) is deliberately absent: it
requires cross-process signalling that has no immediate consumer on
local-subprocess backends and becomes natural to wire up only when the
worker layer itself emits network events.
